    <!-- Maximising Student Engagement - Why -->

      <div class="engagement-why-text">
      <img src="../resources/images/MSE/MSE-Box.png" class="blueheader" alt="Maximising Student Engagement"/>
      <p>In order to maximize learning and to be an effective PE teacher, lessons should be planned so that pupils spend as much time as possible on tasks and as little time as possible on organization and management [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>]. In order to keep in line with the topic, there are three key areas of consideration: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Establishing routines</li>
        <li>Giving Instructions</li>
        <li>Planning for progression</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="engagement-why-image">
        <img src="../resources/images/MSE/Lightbulb.png" alt="Lightbulb"/>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Establishing Routines -->
    <div class="routines">
      <img src="../resources/images/MSE/EstablishingRoutines-Box.png" class="blueheader" alt="Establishing Routines"/>
      <div class="routines-container">
        <p>From the outset of the school year, and each new topic or term, it is hugely beneficial to establish and reinforce efficient routines with your classes. This begins and ends with how you expect students to enter and exit the changing rooms and everything in between, including:</p>
        <img src="../resources/images/MSE/Girl-and-clock.png" alt="Female teacher and large clock"/>
        <ul>
          <li>Taking the register</li>
          <li>Entering and leaving the PE space</li>
          <li>Instructions/demonstrations</li>
          <li>Collecting and returning equipment</li>
          <li>Gaining attention</li>
          <li>Organizing groups</li>
          <li>Transitioning from activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore with so many factors to consider it is obvious why establishing good routines are beneficial for maximizing learning time [<a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>]. In order to do so, it is recommended that at the start of new unit or term that time is taken to plan these routines which can be reinforced in subsequent lessons.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Instructions -->
    <div class="instructions">
      <div class="instructions-container">
        <div class="instructions-left">
          <img src="../resources/images/MSE/StopTeacher-FaceWave.png" alt="Teacher saying 'stop, look and listen'"/>
          <img src="../resources/images/MSE/StopLookListenRogersSpeaks-TopHalf.png" id="teacher-mob" alt="Teacher saying 'stop, look and listen'"/>
          <img src="../resources/images/MSE/StopLookListenRogersSpeaks (1).png" id="teacher-mob-2"/>
        </div>

        <div class="instructions-right">
          <img src="../resources/images/MSE/Instructions-Box2.png" class="blueheader" alt="Instructions"/>
          <p>One of the most common obstacles for maximizing pupils time physically engaged in tasks is excessive teacher talk [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. Teacher talk should be concise and to the point [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">4</a>]. Avoid talking longer than 3-minutes, and if possible make just one point at a time [<a href="#ref4">4</a>]. This does not mean that you should rush through instructions nor talk over students who are chatting as this undermines the teacher’s authority. Instead, develop a familiar phrase to gain attention such as <span>“Stop, look and listen” </span> or a rhythmical clap pattern, then when students are quiet and listening make your instructions short, sharp and punchy! [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>]</p>

    <!-- Planning for Progression -->
    <div class="progression">
      <div class="progression-container">
        <div class="progression-left">
          <img src="../resources/images/MSE/PlanningForProgression-Box.png" class="blueheader" alt="Planning for Progression"/>
          <p>Another important element for maximizing pupils learning time and behavior is planning for <strong>progression</strong>. A good PE lesson should have a balance of <span class="orange">individual</span>, <span class="green">cooperative</span> and <span class="grey">competitive</span> activities with appropriate progression through tasks [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>]. This requires effective pacing by deciding what is considered sufficient time for pupils to make progress without getting bored [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. This could be anywhere from 3-15 minutes depending upon the activity and the age of students (for longer activities, <span class="navy">ensure that extension tasks are ready for students</span>).</p>

          <p>Maximising learning time can always be improved even by the most experienced PE teacher and will evolve like the ever-changing face of our students. Yet it is advantageous to continually reflect on our teaching and identify situations where a different approach may have worked better [<a href="#ref3">3</a>].</p>
