    <div class="motivation-why">
        <p><span class="blue-bold">To be able to motivate all pupils in PE so that they participate in all activities with effort and a keenness to learn and refine skills is an invaluable asset of an outstanding PE teacher. However, for most of us, motivating every single student in our classes to try their best, focus, persevere through their struggles, maintain a positive attitude and enjoy the learning process can feel unattainable and unrealistic. This is due to our recognition that we have students with contrasting attitudes towards PE, for some it is the highlight of their day, whilst others may feel stress, anxiety or even apathy. Therefore, in order for us to motivate pupils so that they can maximize their attainment and hopefully develop a lifelong love for physical activity and learning we need to have the tools to do so [<a href="#references">1, 2</a>].</span></p>

      <div class="motivation-why-list">
        <p>Fortunately, there has been a wealth of research into what teaching behaviors and motivational strategies are most effective when delivering PE, and we can all benefit from understanding the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="orange">Extrinsic</span> <span class="gray">vs</span> <span class="lite-blue">Intrinsic</span> <span class="gray">Motivation</span></li>
            <li><span class="green">Self-determination theory</span></li>

            <li><span class="blue-bold">Establishing a Mastery climate using TARGET</span></li>
          </ul>

    <!-- Motivation Extrinsic Intrinsic-->
    <div class="motivation-types">
      <div class="motivation-types-p1">
        <img src="../resources/images/motivation/trophy.png" alt="Sports Trophy"/>
        <p>Firstly, being able to distinguish between <span class="orange">extrinsic</span> and <span class="lite-blue">intrinsic</span> motivation is an important factor as it helps us identify our students’ drives and motives, and how we recognize and reward attainment. <span class="orange">Extrinsic motivation</span> comes from gaining an <span class="orange-lc">external tangible reward</span> (e.g., trophies, certificates, merits) or social reward (praise, recognition, status or approval by classmates or teachers). Whereas, <span class="lite-blue">intrinsic motivation</span> arises from within an individual and can be identified as doing an activity because it is <span class="lite-blue-lc">naturally satisfying</span> to participate in. Therefore, an intrinsically motivated PE student enjoys putting forth effort to learn as they find it enjoyable to play, learn and improve skills [<a href="#references">1, 3</a>].</p>
      </div>

      <div class="motivation-types-p2">
        <p>For students that struggle to find intrinsic motivation for an activity, extrinsic rewards may temporarily improve their motivation. But for students who are already intrinsically motivated, adding extrinsic rewards, particularly of a controlling nature (e.g., use merits to goad students to behave) may lower their intrinsic motives. Rather, the <span class="orange-lc">best use of extrinsic rewards are informational</span>, which consist of the <span class="orange-lc">teacher providing specific and private feedback</span> about a student’s competence at a certain task [<a href="#references">1, 3</a>]. </p>

        </br>
        <p>Unfortunately, we can’t just simplify motives into two categories (extrinsic and intrinsic) as our human nature is much more complex than that. Therefore, a continuum of motivation emerged called <span class="green">self-determination theory (SDT)</span> which has on one-side ‘amotivation’ and on the other ‘intrinsic motivation’. The table below provides a concise overview of SDT (diagram 1).</p>

    </div>


    <!-- Motivation How  -->
    <div class="motivation-how">
      <p>Essentially, our goals as educators is to first identify where our pupils are along the SDT continuum and then to try to move them towards becoming more intrinsically motivated. An interesting activity you may want to try with your students is to encourage them to discuss their motivation in reference to diagram 1, and for them to indicate where they motivation stems from. </p>
      <p>SDT is based on the premise that humans are motivated by the following <span class="bold">psychological needs</span> - <span class="white-lc">autonomy</span>, competence and <span class="white-lc">relatedness</span> [<a href="#references">1</a>]. In Pink’s (2009) book Drive, the author ascertained that the secrets to motivating people were to provide them with a sense of autonomy, <span class="white-lc">flow</span> (similar to competence), and <span class="white-lc">purpose</span> in their work [<a href="#references">4</a>]. As a result, it could be deduced that there exists four key psychological needs that will help us motivate our students, which are detailed in the table below.</p>

      <img src="../resources/images/motivation/Psychmobile.png" id="psych-mob" alt="Table outlining the four psychological needs: Autonomy, Purpose, Flow, Relatedness"/>
    </div>

    <!-- Motivation Target -->
    <div class="motivation-target">
      <p>As a result of the aforementioned motivation theory, we are provided with an arsenal of knowledge that we can experiment with in order to see how effective they motivate our students in PE. It would be impractical (and unwise) to follow all the theoretical concepts in a single lesson, and with the whole class. As we mentioned earlier, some students will be already intrinsically motivated to try their best in your class. Instead, we can utilize some of these concepts with our less driven students. Whether it be giving them a greater sense of autonomy in the lesson (not complete autonomy, you’re still the teacher who sets the expectations) or helping them find purpose in the activity or in trying their best (even when they don’t feel like it) [1].</p>
      <p>One important strategy to help pupils try their best in your lessons is to establish a <span class="gray-lc">mastery climate</span>. This is where the emphasis is placed on learning, trying hard, persevering through adversity, having self-referenced goals, and making personal progress [1, 5]. This is in contrast to a performance climate where the focus is on winning and social comparison. In order for us to promote a mastery climate, the acronym <span class="gray">TARGET</span> was devised and is detailed below (table 2).</p>

        <div class="conclusion-container">
          <p>In conclusion, in order for us to get the best out of students it is beneficial to understand about extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and that we can help pupils move along the self-determination theory continuum by giving them a greater sense of autonomy, flow, purpose and relatedness. In order to achieve that we should aim to create a mastery climate in our lessons using the TARGET structures where pupils understand that effort and learning is the focus. If you would like to learn more about motivation we recommend reading Drive by Pink (2009) and Morgan et al’s (2015) chapter from Learning to Teach Physical Education in the Secondary School [<a href="#references">1</a>].</p>
