    <!-- Vision -->
    <div class="vision">
      <img src="../resources/images/AboutUs/VisionBox.png" class="blueheader" alt="About Us"/>
      <p>Our vision at the PE Project is pretty simple - we want to provide our PE community with an online library of pedagogically informed and concise articles on the different facets of our wonderful subject, from Assessment strategies to Teaching models. By doing so we hope that more and more PE teachers feel well-equipped with a plethora of tools and strategies which will take their lessons to the next stratisphere! We also want to keep producing high-quality PE resources which will help both specialists and non-specialists alike to lead PE in a holistic manner by emphasising the development of the whole-child (physical, social, emotional, cultural and spiritual). We would love to hear from anyone who wants to contribute to the PE Project!</p>

    <!-- Philosophy  -->
    <div class="webelieve">
      <img src="../resources/images/AboutUs/PhilosophyBox.png" class="blueheader" alt="About Us"/>
      <p>At the PE Project we have currently decided upon seven-principles for ensuring high quality learning in PE: </p>

      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">We believe</span> that students need to know that their teachers <span class="orange">care</span> about them. Theodore Roosevelt put it best “Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care.”</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We believe</span> that learning should be <span class="green">personalised</span> to the specific needs of each pupil, and that it is <span class="bold">student-centered</span> as pupils should lead their own learning and work harder than the teacher.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We believe</span> that in order for pupils to be motivated learners, teachers should provide them with increasing amounts of <span class="blue-bold-L">autonomy</span> - a sense of freedom or choice over what they are learning, and how they will learn it.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We believe</span> that teachers should help students find their optimal state of flow, or <span class="orange">Mastery</span> so that pupils are able to find the sweet spot where the challenge is neither too easy, nor too hard.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">We believe</span> it is vital that pupils find <span class="lite-blue">purpose</span> in their learning, and can understand how it impacts their own and others’ lives, both now and in the future.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">we believe</span> that all learning experience should be as <span class="lite-grey">authentic </span> as possible, and should replicate closely to real-life situations, whether dealing with physical, mental or social challenges.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Foundation -->
    <div class="foundation">
      <p><span class="blue-bold">We have presented these principles on seven-pillars, built upon a foundation of high expectations. Please note that our principles are not set in stone, rather they are depicted as banners in front of each pillar, as we believe that as we all grow as educators so will our teaching philosophy. Therefore, we should always look for new and better ways of doing things which will ultimately shape our beliefs and philosophy.</span></p>
